    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>WhaleSong Coin takes its inspiration from the real-world story of humpback whale songs recorded by biologist Dr. Roger Payne in 1970. These haunting and beautiful recordings revealed that whales communicate with complex songs that echoed across oceans. When the public heard these songs for the first time, it touched the hearts of millions and fueled a global movement to protect whales from commercial whaling. As a result, many countries enacted strong protections for whales, and the International Whaling Commission eventually banned commercial whaling.</p>
            <p>By launching WhaleSong Coin, we honor this powerful legacy. We aim to build a modern, digital community around a meme token that channels the spirit of collaboration and compassion that saved the whales. Through fun and creativity, we hope to raise awareness about ocean conservation and support real-world environmental initiatives.</p>

            <p>Our mission is to create a fun and engaging community token that directs part of its activity toward charity and environmental initiatives. We believe in the power of decentralized communities to effect positive change. By combining the excitement of memes with the seriousness of ocean conservation, we aim to inspire our supporters to join us on this journey.</p>
