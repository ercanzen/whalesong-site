            <h2>Vesting & Anti-Rug Measures</h2>
            <p>To foster trust and align long-term incentives, team and advisor tokens are locked with a gradual vesting schedule over 24 months. Contract code is publicly verified, and liquidity is locked for a period defined by the community. Multi-signature wallets and time-locks ensure that no single party can act unilaterally.</p>
